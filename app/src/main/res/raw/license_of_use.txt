3.6 We do not check the contents stored by you in advance. However, we reserve the right to block or delete these at any time, in particular if we become aware of a legal violation of a specific content or specific contents. Since the data and documents on the Smart4Health platform are encrypted end to end, such blockage or deletion shall require receipt of a corresponding notification of abuse, for example, from a law enforcement agency.


4. Limitation of liability

4.1 The provider is liable for contractual and other claims of the user only for damages of the user (1) which the provider, his legal representatives or vicarious agents have caused intentionally or grossly negligently, (2) from the injury to life, body or health, which is based on a breach of duty of the provider or one of its legal representatives or vicarious agents, (3) in cases of liability according to the German Product Liability Act, the assumption of a guarantee or damage that is due to fraudulent misrepresentation and (4) which have arisen as a result of a breach of an obligation, the fulfillment of which is essential for the proper execution of the contract and the observance of which the user regularly relies on and may rely on (so-called cardinal obligation or German „Kardinalpflicht“).

4.2 In cases (1), (2), (3) of the preceding paragraph, the provider’s liability shall be unrestricted. In other cases the liability is limited to the foreseeable, contract-typical damage.

4.3 In cases other than those mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 and notwithstanding the following paragraph, the liability of the provider is excluded irrespective of the legal grounds.

4.4 The provisions of this limitation of liability do not change the legal burden of proof.

4.5 The above limitations of liability shall apply accordingly to the personal liability of legal representatives, employees and vicarious agents of the provider.


5. Change of the Terms of Use

5.1 With your consent or if your consent is deemed to have been given pursuant to the following paragraph, we may amend the Terms of Use (for example, when we introduce new functionalities).

If you do not object within 6 weeks after receipt of this notification in text form, your consent to the change shall be deemed given and the changes shall take effect at the announced time. We will refer to this consequence separately in the notification.

5.3 Irrespective of the above provisions, we reserve the right to amend the Terms of Use with effect for the future, insofar as this does not affect essential provisions of the contractual relationship with the user and these amendments are necessary in order to take account of developments (for example, changes in the legal situation or supreme court rulings, fundamental changes in market conditions which lead to a disruption of the basis of business) which were not foreseeable by us and the non-consideration of which would lead to a fundamental disruption of the contractual relationship.


6. Final provisions, miscellaneous

6.1 There are no subsidiary agreements.

6.2 Should individual provisions of these Terms of Use be or become invalid in whole or in part, the remainder of the contract shall remain valid. In this case, the invalid provision shall be replaced by the statutory provision.
